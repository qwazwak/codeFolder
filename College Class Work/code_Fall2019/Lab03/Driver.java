Write a driver to obtain the ice cream cone order from the user. Allow multiple ice cream cones to be ordered, and keep a running total of the price of the ice cream cones. Of course, wait (loop) for the user to input valid entries. Thus, you are checking for valid entries in the driver and in the constructor of your objects. This is defensive programming, although it results in some code duplication.
In addition to main, include the following methods in your driver:
1. public static Flavor getFlavorChoice() //look at the methods available in the Flavors class 2. public static Topping getToppingChoice() //look at the methods available in the Toppings class 3. public static int getScoopsChoice() 4. public static Cone getConeChoice()
All of these methods take input from the user (using Keyboard.class)

  public static void main(String[] args){
