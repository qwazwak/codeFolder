/*
HEADER FILE- This is just declaring or prototyping functions and telling people how to use it
To use Rus's Big Bad Library:
	Include it with #include "BigBadCSCLib-Rus.h"
	and when LINKING make sure that this header and the BigBadCSCLib-Rus.o are in the same directory as your file, and link them IE: g++ -o myprogram.exe mypProgram.o BigBadCSCLib-Rus.o
	
Comment GALORE!




DEFINES - If you have a program that needs certain specific functions that are usually skipped use a define
example: for a tictactoe program make sure to have #define TicTacToe

//Include gaurd - If this pseudolibrary is already defined, dont add it again
